# bs-nconf
ReasonML bindings to the [mysql2][mysql2] library.

This is a very rough implementation that will enable very simple use cases.

## Usage

## How do I install it?

Inside of a BuckleScript project:
```shell
yarn install --save bs-mysql2
```

Then add `bs-mysql2` to your `bs-dependencies` in `bsconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "bs-dependencies": [
    "bs-mysql2"
  ]
}
```
